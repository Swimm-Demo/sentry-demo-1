# [Initializing Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/gzb85xn8#initializing-sentry)

To start using Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring, the first step is to initialize Sentry in your application. This involves setting up the Sentry SDK with the necessary configuration details such as the DSN (Data Source Name), which uniquely identifies your project in Sentry. This step ensures that your application is ready to capture and send error and performance data to Sentry.

# [Capturing Errors and Performance Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/gzb85xn8#capturing-errors-and-performance-data)

Once Sentry is initialized, it automatically starts capturing errors and performance data from your application. This includes unhandled exceptions, performance bottlenecks, and other relevant metrics. The captured data is then sent to Sentry's servers for further processing. This step is crucial as it ensures that all relevant issues and performance metrics are tracked without requiring manual intervention from the developers.

# [Viewing and Analyzing Data in Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/gzb85xn8#viewing-and-analyzing-data-in-sentry)

After the data is captured and sent to Sentry, it can be viewed and analyzed through Sentry's web interface. This interface provides detailed insights into the errors and performance issues, including stack traces, error frequency, and affected users. By analyzing this data, developers can quickly identify and resolve issues, improving the overall quality and performance of the application. This step is essential for maintaining a high level of application reliability and user satisfaction.
