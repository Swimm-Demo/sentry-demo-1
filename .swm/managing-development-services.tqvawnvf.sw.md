# [Configuring the Environment](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/lm1rl02c#setting-up-the-environment)

The first step in managing development services is configuring the environment. This involves ensuring that all necessary warnings are displayed, adding additional MIME types that are useful for static files, and checking the existence of configuration files. This step ensures that the environment is correctly set up to run the development services smoothly.

# [Preparing Necessary Containers](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/lm1rl02c#managing-development-services)

Once the environment is configured, the next step is to prepare the necessary containers. This involves setting up the containers that will run the development services. The containers are prepared based on the project requirements and any specified configurations. This step ensures that the services have the necessary infrastructure to run.

# [Starting Specified Services](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/lm1rl02c#managing-development-services)

After the containers are prepared, the specified services are started using a thread pool executor. This allows multiple services to be started simultaneously in the background, improving efficiency. The services are started based on the list provided, and any services that need to be excluded can be specified. This step ensures that all required services are up and running for development purposes.

# [Checking the Health of Services](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/lm1rl02c#managing-development-services)

The final step is to check the health of the services to ensure they are running correctly. This involves monitoring the services and verifying that they are functioning as expected. If any issues are detected, they can be addressed promptly to avoid disruptions. This step ensures that the development environment remains stable and reliable.
