# [Initializing the component](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/m2ixa9cm#codeownerfiletable)

The CodeOwnerFileTable component is responsible for rendering and managing the table of code owner files. When the component is initialized, it sets up the API and organization context. If there are no code owner files, the component will not render anything. This ensures that the user interface remains clean and only displays relevant information.

# [Viewing code owner files](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/m2ixa9cm#handleview)

When a user wants to view a code owner file, the component opens a modal displaying the details of the selected file. This allows users to quickly access and review the contents of a code owner file without navigating away from the current page. The modal provides a user-friendly interface for viewing detailed information.

# [Synchronizing code owner files](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/m2ixa9cm#handlesync)

Synchronizing a code owner file involves fetching the latest version from the server and updating the project with this new version. This ensures that the code owner files are always up-to-date with the latest changes. If the synchronization is successful, the user interface is updated to reflect the new version, and a success message is displayed to inform the user. If an error occurs, an error message is shown to notify the user of the issue.

# [Deleting code owner files](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/m2ixa9cm#handledelete)

Deleting a code owner file involves making a request to the server to remove the specified file. If the deletion is successful, the file is removed from the user interface, and a success message is displayed to inform the user. If an error occurs during the deletion process, an error message is shown to notify the user. This functionality allows users to manage their code owner files effectively by removing outdated or unnecessary files.
