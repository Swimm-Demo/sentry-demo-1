# Overview

Components in the Settings section are primarily styled elements that structure and organize the layout and navigation of the settings pages. This document will guide you through the key components and their functionalities.

# Layout Management

The `SettingsLayout` function manages the overall layout, including the visibility of the navigation menu on different screen sizes. This ensures a responsive design that adapts to various devices.

# Visual Structure

Styled components like `SettingsColumn`, `HeaderContent`, and `NavMenuToggle` are used to define the visual structure and behavior of the settings interface. These components help in maintaining a consistent look and feel across the settings pages.

# Navigation Handling

The `SettingsNavigation` class handles the rendering of navigation items, including hooks and configurations. This ensures a consistent navigation experience across different settings pages.

# Specific Functionalities

Other components, such as `ProjectItem` and `SettingsBreadcrumb`, provide specific functionalities like displaying project badges and breadcrumb navigation within the settings.

# Styled Components

# Components Endpoints

Components in the settings section also interact with various endpoints to perform specific actions. Below are some examples.

## <SwmToken path="static/app/views/settings/components/dataScrubbing/submitRules.tsx" pos="46:2:2" line-data="function submitRules(api: Client, endpoint: string, rules: Array&lt;Rule&gt;) {">`submitRules`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/settings/components/dataScrubbing/submitRules.tsx" pos="46:2:2" line-data="function submitRules(api: Client, endpoint: string, rules: Array&lt;Rule&gt;) {">`submitRules`</SwmToken> function is used to submit data scrubbing rules to a specified endpoint. It formats the rules and sends them as a PUT request to the provided endpoint.

## <SwmToken path="static/app/views/settings/components/dataScrubbing/modals/modalManager.tsx" pos="112:3:3" line-data="  async loadSourceSuggestions() {">`loadSourceSuggestions`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/settings/components/dataScrubbing/modals/modalManager.tsx" pos="112:3:3" line-data="  async loadSourceSuggestions() {">`loadSourceSuggestions`</SwmToken> function fetches source suggestions for data scrubbing based on the event ID and project ID. It sends a request to the `/organizations/{orgSlug}/data-scrubbing-selector-suggestions/` endpoint and updates the state with the fetched suggestions.
