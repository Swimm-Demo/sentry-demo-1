This document will cover the process of error tracking and performance monitoring using Sentry. We'll cover:

1. Initializing Sentry in the application
2. Capturing errors and performance data
3. Viewing and analyzing the captured data in Sentry.

# [Initializing Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/g8z1gdem#initializing-sentry)

To start using Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring, we first need to initialize it in our application. This involves setting up the Sentry SDK with the necessary configuration details such as the DSN (Data Source Name), which uniquely identifies our project in Sentry. This step ensures that our application is ready to capture and send error and performance data to Sentry.

# [Capturing Errors and Performance Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/g8z1gdem#capturing-errors-and-performance-data)

Once Sentry is initialized, it automatically starts capturing errors and performance data from the application. This includes unhandled exceptions, performance bottlenecks, and other relevant metrics. The captured data is then sent to Sentry's servers for further analysis. This step is crucial for identifying issues in real-time and understanding the performance characteristics of the application.

# [Viewing and Analyzing Data in Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/g8z1gdem#viewing-and-analyzing-data-in-sentry)

After the data is captured and sent to Sentry, it can be viewed and analyzed through the Sentry dashboard. The dashboard provides various tools and visualizations to help understand the nature and impact of the errors and performance issues. Users can filter and search through the data, view detailed error reports, and track performance metrics over time. This step is essential for diagnosing problems, prioritizing fixes, and improving the overall quality and performance of the application.
