# What is Relocations in Endpoints

Relocations refer to the process of moving organizations and their associated data to a new environment, specifically to [sentry.io](http://sentry.io). The process involves several steps, including preprocessing, validating, importing, postprocessing, and notifying.

# Relocation Endpoints

Endpoints related to relocations handle various actions such as starting, pausing, unpausing, and canceling the relocation process.

## Relocation Notifications

Relocations also involve sending notifications to users about the status of their relocation requests, such as when a relocation has started or succeeded. This template is used to notify users that their relocation request has been accepted and is in progress.

## Relocation Success

This template is used to notify users that their relocation request was successful and provides additional information about the changes.

## Unpausing Relocations

The <SwmToken path="src/sentry/api/endpoints/relocations/unpause.py" pos="33:2:2" line-data="class RelocationUnpauseEndpoint(Endpoint):">`RelocationUnpauseEndpoint`</SwmToken> class manages the unpausing of an <SwmToken path="src/sentry/api/endpoints/relocations/pause.py" pos="43:5:7" line-data="        Pause an in-progress relocation.">`in-progress`</SwmToken> relocation, ensuring that the process can be safely resumed from a paused state.

## \_unpause Function

The <SwmToken path="src/sentry/api/endpoints/relocations/unpause.py" pos="41:3:3" line-data="    def _unpause(self, request: Request, relocation: Relocation) -&gt; Response | None:">`_unpause`</SwmToken> function is a helper function that performs the actual unpausing in a <SwmToken path="src/sentry/api/endpoints/relocations/unpause.py" pos="43:19:21" line-data="        Helper function to do the actual unpausing in a transaction-safe manner.

It only returns a <SwmToken path="src/sentry/api/endpoints/relocations/unpause.py" pos="41:22:22" line-data="    def _unpause(self, request: Request, relocation: Relocation) -&gt; Response | None:">`Response`</SwmToken> if the relocation failed; otherwise, it returns `None` and lets the calling function perform the serialization for the return payload.
