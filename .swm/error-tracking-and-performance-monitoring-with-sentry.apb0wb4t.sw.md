title: Error Tracking and Performance Monitoring with Sentry
---
This document will cover the process of error tracking and performance monitoring using Sentry in the sentry-demo-1 repository. We'll cover:

1. Initializing Sentry in the application
2. Capturing errors and performance data
3. Viewing and analyzing the captured data in Sentry.

# [Initializing Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/qrmcagu0#initializing-sentry)

To start using Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring, we first need to initialize it in the application. This involves setting up the Sentry SDK with the appropriate configuration. The configuration includes the DSN (Data Source Name), which uniquely identifies the project in Sentry, and other settings like environment, release, and sample rate. This step ensures that Sentry is ready to capture any errors or performance data from the application.

# [Capturing Errors and Performance Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/qrmcagu0#capturing-errors-and-performance-data)

Once Sentry is initialized, it automatically starts capturing errors and performance data from the application. Errors can be captured from various sources such as unhandled exceptions, manual error reports, and logging frameworks. Performance data includes metrics like transaction durations, page load times, and API response times. This data is crucial for identifying and diagnosing issues in the application, helping developers understand where and why problems occur.

# [Viewing and Analyzing Data in Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/qrmcagu0#viewing-and-analyzing-data-in-sentry)

After capturing errors and performance data, the next step is to view and analyze this data in the Sentry dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all the captured events, allowing users to filter and search for specific issues. Users can view detailed information about each error, including stack traces, user context, and environment details. Performance data is presented in the form of charts and graphs, making it easy to identify trends and bottlenecks. This analysis helps in prioritizing and addressing the most critical issues affecting the application's performance and stability.
