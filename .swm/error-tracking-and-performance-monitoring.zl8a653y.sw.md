# [Initializing Sentry](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/v5usuxxh#initializing-sentry)

To start using Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring, the first step is to initialize Sentry in your application. This involves setting up the Sentry SDK with the necessary configuration details such as the DSN (Data Source Name), which uniquely identifies your project in Sentry. This step ensures that your application is ready to capture and send error and performance data to Sentry.

# [Capturing Errors](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/v5usuxxh#capturing-errors)

Once Sentry is initialized, it can automatically capture and report errors that occur in your application. This includes unhandled exceptions, runtime errors, and other issues that can affect the user experience. Capturing errors helps in identifying and resolving issues quickly, ensuring a smoother experience for the end users. The captured errors are sent to the Sentry dashboard, where they can be reviewed and analyzed.

# [Monitoring Performance](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/v5usuxxh#monitoring-performance)

In addition to error tracking, Sentry also provides performance monitoring capabilities. This involves capturing performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and transaction durations. Monitoring performance helps in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing the application's performance. The performance data is visualized in the Sentry dashboard, providing insights into how the application is performing and where improvements can be made.
