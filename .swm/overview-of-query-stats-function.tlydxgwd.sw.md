# [Gathering crash-free statistics](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/etyw02nv#query_stats)

The Query Stats Function is responsible for collecting data on how many sessions and users are crash-free. This involves calling another function to get the total and crash-free numbers for both sessions and users. The data is then processed to ensure accuracy and completeness.

# [Formatting the data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/etyw02nv#query_stats)

Once the crash-free statistics are gathered, the data is formatted into a dictionary. This dictionary includes the date, total users, crash-free users, total sessions, and crash-free sessions. This step ensures that the data is organized in a way that is easy to understand and use for further analysis or reporting.
