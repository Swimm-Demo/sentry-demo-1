# [Initializing the API Client](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8i2fpsuo#initializing-the-api-client)

The first step in the useGenericDiscoverQuery flow is to initialize the API client. This is essential because it sets up the necessary communication channel with the Sentry API. Without initializing the API client, subsequent steps like constructing the request URL and performing the query would not be possible. This step ensures that the system is ready to send and receive data.

# [Constructing the Request URL and Payload](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8i2fpsuo#constructing-the-request-url-and-payload)

Once the API client is initialized, the next step is to construct the request URL and payload. The request URL is built using the organization slug and the specific route for the query. The payload includes all the necessary parameters and options required for the query. This step is crucial as it defines what data will be fetched and how the query will be executed. For example, if the query is to fetch error logs, the payload will include parameters like time range, error types, and other filters.

# [Performing the Query](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8i2fpsuo#performing-the-query)

After constructing the request URL and payload, the query is performed using the useQuery hook. This hook manages the execution of the query and handles the state of the request, such as loading, success, and error states. Performing the query involves sending the constructed request to the Sentry API and waiting for the response. This step is where the actual data retrieval happens, and it is essential for fetching the required information based on the constructed payload.

# [Handling Responses](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8i2fpsuo#handling-responses)

The final step in the useGenericDiscoverQuery flow is handling the responses. Once the query is performed, the response is received and processed. This involves extracting the necessary data from the response, managing any errors that occurred during the query, and retrieving the status code. Handling responses ensures that the data fetched is correctly processed and any issues are appropriately managed. For example, if the query fails, the error handling mechanism will capture the error and provide relevant feedback to the user.
