# Introduction to Account Settings

Account settings refer to the user-specific configurations within the application. These settings include various sections such as account details, security settings, notification preferences, and email addresses.

# Account Settings Layout

The `AccountSettingsLayout` component is responsible for rendering the account settings page, including navigation and child components. The `AccountSettingsNavigation` function generates the navigation items for the account settings, such as account details, security, notifications, and email addresses.

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/settings/account/accountDetails.tsx" pos="42:2:2" line-data="function AccountDetails() {">`AccountDetails`</SwmToken> function is responsible for rendering the account details page. It fetches user data and displays a form for updating account details. The form includes fields such as user ID and other account-specific information. The function handles form submission and updates the user data in the Config Store.

```tsx
function AccountDetails() {
  const organization = useOrganization({allowNull: true});
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const {
    data: user,
    isPending,
    isError,
    refetch,
  } = useApiQuery<User>(USER_ENDPOINT_QUERY_KEY, {staleTime: 0});

  if (isPending) {
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <SettingsPageHeader title={t('Account Details')} />
        <LoadingIndicator />
      </Fragment>
    );
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <LoadingError onRetry={refetch} />;
```

It includes functionalities for handling session closures, adding two-factor authentication, and displaying the status of various authentication methods. The function interacts with the API to update security settings and provides feedback to the user.

```tsx
            model={this.formModel}
            apiMethod="POST"
            apiEndpoint={this.authenticatorEndpoint}

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/settings/account/accountAuthorizations.tsx" pos="30:2:2" line-data="function AccountAuthorizations() {">`AccountAuthorizations`</SwmToken> function handles the display and management of authorized applications. It fetches the list of authorized applications and allows the user to revoke access to any application. The function interacts with the API to update the list of authorizations and provides feedback to the user.

```tsx
function AccountAuthorizations() {
  const api = useApi();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const ENDPOINT = '/api-authorizations/';

  const {data, isPending, isError, refetch} = useApiQuery<Authorization[]>([ENDPOINT], {
    staleTime: 0,
  });

  if (isPending) {
    return <LoadingIndicator />;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <LoadingError onRetry={refetch} />;
  }

  const handleRevoke = async (authorization: Authorization) => {
    const oldData = data;
    setApiQueryData<Authorization[]>(queryClient, [ENDPOINT], prevData =>
      prevData.filter(a => a.id !== authorization.id)
```
