# Getting Started with Trace Details

New trace details provide an in-depth view of the performance data collected during the execution of a transaction. This includes various metrics and logs that help in identifying performance bottlenecks and errors.

## Organized Sections

The details are organized into different sections such as issues, profiling, spans, and transactions. Each section provides specific insights into different aspects of the trace.

## Utilities and Components

The trace details also include various utilities and components such as error handling, missing instrumentation warnings, and styles to enhance the user experience.

This file handles the error details within the trace drawer, providing insights into any errors encountered during the trace.

```tsx
import {useMemo} from 'react';
import {useTheme} from '@emotion/react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

import {LinkButton} from 'sentry/components/button';
import {
  getStacktrace,
  StackTracePreviewContent,
} from 'sentry/components/groupPreviewTooltip/stackTracePreview';
import LoadingIndicator from 'sentry/components/loadingIndicator';
