title: Determining Issue Resolution State
---
This document will cover the process of determining the resolution state of an issue. We'll cover:

1. Fetching 'done' statuses for a project
2. Checking the old and new states of the issue
3. Deciding whether the issue should be resolved or unresolved.

# [Fetching 'done' statuses for a project](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/38lzwca9#fetching-done-statuses)

The first step in determining the resolution state of an issue is to identify the states that are considered 'done' for a project. This involves retrieving all possible states for work items in the project and filtering them to include only those that are categorized as 'done'. This ensures that we have a clear understanding of which states indicate that an issue is completed.

Next, we need to check the previous and current states of the issue. This involves comparing the state of the issue before and after a change. By doing this, we can determine if the issue has transitioned from a non-done state to a done state or vice versa. This comparison is crucial for deciding the resolution status of the issue.

Finally, based on the comparison of the old and new states, we decide whether the issue should be marked as resolved or unresolved. If the issue transitions from a non-done state to a done state, it should be marked as resolved. Conversely, if it transitions from a done state to a non-done state, it should be marked as unresolved. This decision ensures that the issue's resolution status accurately reflects its current state.
