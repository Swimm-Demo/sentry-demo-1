# Getting Started with Team Insights Overview

Team insights provide a detailed view of the performance and health of different teams within an organization. This includes metrics such as issues encountered, project health, and other relevant statistics.

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/index.tsx" pos="13:2:2" line-data="function TeamInsightsContainer({children, organization}: Props) {">`TeamInsightsContainer`</SwmToken> component is responsible for rendering the team insights feature. It ensures that the necessary features are enabled and that the appropriate project messages are displayed.

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/index.tsx" pos="13:2:2" line-data="function TeamInsightsContainer({children, organization}: Props) {">`TeamInsightsContainer`</SwmToken> component uses the <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/index.tsx" pos="15:2:2" line-data="    &lt;Feature organization={organization} features=&quot;team-insights&quot;&gt;">`Feature`</SwmToken> and <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/index.tsx" pos="16:2:2" line-data="      &lt;NoProjectMessage organization={organization}&gt;">`NoProjectMessage`</SwmToken> components to render the team insights feature. It also ensures that the necessary features are enabled and that the appropriate project messages are displayed.

```tsx
function TeamInsightsContainer({children, organization}: Props) {
  return (
    <Feature organization={organization} features="team-insights">
      <NoProjectMessage organization={organization}>
        {children && isValidElement(children)

      </NoProjectMessage>
    </Feature>
  );
}

## TeamStatsIssues

The `TeamStatsIssues` component fetches and displays issues related to the team. It uses the <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/index.tsx" pos="13:8:8" line-data="function TeamInsightsContainer({children, organization}: Props) {">`organization`</SwmToken> context to retrieve the relevant data and stores the selected team ID in local storage.

The <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/health.tsx" pos="29:2:2" line-data="function TeamStatsHealth({location, router}: Props) {">`TeamStatsHealth`</SwmToken> component provides an overview of the health of the team's projects. It uses the <SwmToken path="static/app/views/organizationStats/teamInsights/health.tsx" pos="30:3:3" line-data="  const organization = useOrganization();">`organization`</SwmToken> context and stores the selected team ID in local storage.

```tsx
  const organization = useOrganization();
  const {teams, isLoading, isError} = useUserTeams();

  useRouteAnalyticsEventNames('team_insights.viewed', 'Team Insights: Viewed');

  const query = location?.query ?? {};
  const localStorageKey = `teamInsightsSelectedTeamId:${organization.slug}`;

  let localTeamId: string | null | undefined =
    query.team ?? localStorage.getItem(localStorageKey);
  if (localTeamId && !teams.find(team => team.id === localTeamId)) {
    localTeamId = null;
  }
  const currentTeamId = localTeamId ?? teams[0]?.id;
  const currentTeam = teams.find(team => team.id === currentTeamId) as

    | undefined;
  const projects = currentTeam?.projects ?? [];

  const {period, start, end, utc} = dataDatetime(query);
