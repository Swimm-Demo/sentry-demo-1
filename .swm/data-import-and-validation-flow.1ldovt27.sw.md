title: Data Import and Validation Flow
---
This document will cover the Data Import and Validation Flow, which includes:

1. Exporting the current state of the database
2. Clearing the database
3. Importing the data back into the database
4. Validating the imported data against the expected data.

# [Exporting the Current State of the Database](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ftlxhv9s#export-the-current-state-of-the-database)

The first step in the data import and validation flow is to export the current state of the database. This involves creating a snapshot of the database's current state and saving it to a temporary file. This snapshot will serve as the 'expected' data that we will later compare against the 'actual' data after re-importing it. This step ensures that we have a reference point for validation.

# [Clearing the Database](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ftlxhv9s#clear-the-database)

After exporting the current state, the database is cleared to ensure a clean state. This step is crucial because it removes any existing data that might interfere with the validation process. By starting with an empty database, we can accurately assess whether the imported data matches the expected data.

# [Importing the Data Back into the Database](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ftlxhv9s#import-the-data-back-into-the-database)

Once the database is cleared, the next step is to import the previously exported data back into the database. This involves reading the data from the temporary file and writing it into the database. This step is essential for restoring the database to its previous state, allowing us to validate the integrity of the import process.

# [Validating the Imported Data Against the Expected Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ftlxhv9s#validate-the-imported-data-against-the-expected-data)

The final step in the flow is to validate the imported data against the expected data. This involves comparing the data in the database after the import with the data in the temporary file created during the export. The goal is to ensure that the data matches exactly, confirming that the import process was successful and that no data was lost or corrupted. This validation step is critical for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the reliability of the import process.
