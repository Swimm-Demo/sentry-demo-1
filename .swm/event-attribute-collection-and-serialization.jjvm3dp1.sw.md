# [Collecting Event Attributes](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ny09n17k#get_attrs-function)

The process begins with collecting various pieces of information about an event. This includes crash files, user data, context data, SDK data, and entries. These attributes are essential for understanding the event's context and impact. For example, crash files provide insights into what went wrong, while user data helps identify who was affected.

# [Organizing Event Attributes](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ny09n17k#get_attrs-function)

Once the attributes are collected, they are organized into a structured format. This involves compiling the data into a dictionary that categorizes each piece of information. For instance, user data is grouped together, context data is placed in its own section, and so on. This organization is crucial for ensuring that the data is easily accessible and understandable for further processing.

# [Serializing Event Attributes](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ny09n17k#serialize-function)

The next step is to serialize the organized event attributes. Serialization converts the structured data into a format suitable for API responses. This means transforming the data into a standardized format that can be easily transmitted and understood by clients. During serialization, various components such as errors, messages, tags, context, packages, and metadata are processed to ensure that all necessary information is included.

# [Updating Event Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/ny09n17k#update-function)

Finally, the update function ensures that any changes to the event data are properly reflected in the system. This involves updating the dashboard and its associated widgets and queries based on the provided validated data. The function handles the creation, updating, and deletion of widgets to maintain consistency with the incoming data. Additionally, it schedules updates for project configurations to ensure that the system remains up-to-date.
