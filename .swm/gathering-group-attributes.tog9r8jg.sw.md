# [Fetching Related Objects and Populating Caches](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/96qfp85z#gathering-group-attributes)

The process begins by fetching related objects and populating caches for a list of groups. This step ensures that all necessary data is readily available for subsequent operations. For example, it fetches the organization related to each group to avoid making unnecessary queries later. This step is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring that the data is consistent and up-to-date.

# [Collecting Various Data Points](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/96qfp85z#gathering-group-attributes)

Next, the system collects various data points for each group. These data points include bookmarks, seen groups, and subscriptions. For instance, if a user is authenticated, the system will gather all the groups that the user has bookmarked or seen recently. This information is essential for providing a personalized user experience, as it allows the system to display relevant groups to the user based on their past interactions.

# [Compiling Data into a Dictionary](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBc2VudHJ5LWRlbW8tMSUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/96qfp85z#gathering-group-attributes)

Finally, all the collected data is compiled into a dictionary for each group. This dictionary includes various attributes such as the group's ID, title, status, assigned user, and other metadata. This structured format makes it easier to manage and access group-related information, facilitating efficient data retrieval and manipulation for different use cases, such as displaying group details in the user interface or performing analytics.
